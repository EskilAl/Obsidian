## Dark Current
- Dark current is a current that flows even when **no photons** are incident on the camera
- Dependent on the temperatures of the sensor
- The dark current is a thermal effect and can therefore be reduced by cooling the sensor
- The longer the exposure the greater the contribution of dark current
- Dark current is also important design considerations in Machine vision systems 


### Dark Current subtraction
- Detector noise & dark current

### Shading correction
- a. shaded test pattern
- b. Estimated shading pattern
- c. product of a by the reciprocal of b

### Image multiplication and division for masking
- Digital dental X-ray image
- ROI  mask for isolating teeth with fillings


### Image Decimation and Interpolation 
- Decimation is the reduction in dimension or resolution of the image() subsampling
	- Decimation of 2, results in half the size of the original image.
	- Simples method is skipping of every other pixel.
- Interpolation is the increased in dimension or resolution of the image by averaging or other mathematical operations
