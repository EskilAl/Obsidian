## Dark Current
- Dark current is a current that flows even when **no photons** are incident on the camera
- Dependent on the temperatures of the sensor
- The dark current is a thermal effect and can therefore be reduced by cooling the sensor
- The longer the exposure the greater the contribution of dark current
- Dark current is also important design considerations in Machine vision systems
