# The visible spectrum
- Near IR<- 700 nm <-> 400 nm
- Light sources are characterized by their **spectral power disruption** (also reffered to as radiance specrum
- Surfaces that reflect light are characterized by theirs spectral **reflectance 
- **Radiance** is the total amount of energy that flows from the light source, and usually measured in watts (W)


# Human visual System (HVS)
- Iris
- Pupil 
- Sclera
- Cornea

- Light Reception
	- Rodes
		- Outer segment is rod shaped 
	- Cones 
		- Outer segment is cone shaped
		- Found mainly in the fovea, so can only detect images in the center of retina 
		- Poor sensitivity 
		- 3 types, corresponding to color vision Photopic or bright light vision
		- S cones
