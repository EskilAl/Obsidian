# The visible spectrum
- Near IR<- 700 nm <-> 400 nm
- Light sources are characterized by their **spectral power disruption** (also reffered to as radiance specrum
- Surfaces that reflect light are characterized by theirs spectral **reflectance 
- **Radiance** is the total amount of energy that flows from the light source, and usually measured in watts (W)


# Human visual System (HVS)
- Iris
- Pupil 
- Sclera
- Cornea

- Light Reception
	- Rodes
		- Outer segment is rod shaped 
	- Cones 
		- Outer segment is cone shaped
		- Found mainly in the fovea, so can only detect images in the center of retina 
		- Poor sensitivity 
		- 3 types, corresponding to color vision Photopic or bright light vision
		- S cones 

## Colors 
- We all see Colors differently 
- Metamerism 

signalc = 720nn to 380 nn I(SIGMA)* R(SIGMA)* Sc(SIGMA) dSIGMA

- There are many possible combinations 

## Brightness Adaptation and Discrimination
- The range of light intensity level to which the human visual system can adapt is enormous on the order of 10^10 from the scotopic threshold to the flare limit.
- Intensity as perceived by the human visual system is a logarithmic function of the light intensity incident on the eye.


## Mach band effect
- Visual system tends to undershoot or overshoot around the boundary of regions of different intensities.


## Multiple views 
- Why multiple views?
	- Structure and
- Visual Cues for 3d
	- Shading 
	- Perspectives 
	- Texture 
	- Highlights
	- Shadows 
	- Inter

## Optical illusions 


# What is an Image?
- A two- dimensional function, f(x,y) where x
