# The visible spectrum
- Near IR<- 700 nm <-> 400 nm
- Light sources are characterized by their **spectral power disruption** (also referred to as radiance spectrum
- Surfaces that reflect light are characterized by theirs spectral **reflectance 
- **Radiance** is the total amount of energy that flows from the light source, and usually measured in watts (W)


# Human visual System (HVS)
- Iris
- Pupil 
- Sclera
- Cornea

- Light Reception
	- Rodes
		- Outer segment is rod shaped 
	- Cones 
		- Outer segment is cone shaped
		- Found mainly in the fovea, so can only detect images in the center of retina 
		- Poor sensitivity 
		- 3 types, corresponding to color vision Photopic or bright light vision
		- S cones 

## Colors 
- We all see Colors differently 
- Metamerism 

signalc = 720nn to 380 nn I(SIGMA)* R(SIGMA)* Sc(SIGMA) dSIGMA

- There are many possible combinations 

## Brightness Adaptation and Discrimination
- The range of light intensity level to which the human visual system can adapt is enormous on the order of 10^10 from the scotopic threshold to the flare limit.
- Intensity as perceived by the human visual system is a logarithmic function of the light intensity incident on the eye.


## Mach band effect
- Visual system tends to undershoot or overshoot around the boundary of regions of different intensities.


## Multiple views 
- Why multiple views?
	- Structure and
- Visual Cues for 3d
	- Shading 
	- Perspectives 
	- Texture 
	- Highlights
	- Shadows 
	- Inter

## Optical illusions 


# What is an Image?
- A two- dimensional function, **f(x ,y)** where **x** and **y** are spatial (Plane) coordinates, and the amplitude of f at any pair of coordinates **(x ,y)** is called the intensity or gray level of the image at that point. 


## The origins of Digital images
- Initially developed in the newspaper industry's 
- Space applications in later 1960s
- Medical imaging in early 1970s 


### x Ray images 
- Circuit boards
- Chest X-ray 


### Ultrasound images
- Hospitals

### Thermal images
- Checking temperatures of people 

### Spectral images 
- In normal camera we have RGB, 3 different panes red, green and blue.
- but in a spectral image, we capture up to 100 layers sometime even more.


### Computer generated images


### Why do we study image formation 
- Input -> Sensing device -> interpreting device -> bowl, oranges, bananas, lemons, peaches 
1. Input data
	1. Images
	2. Videos
2. Pre-processing

### Interaction of light-object 
- Illuminant 
- Object
- Detector
- Diffusion("Dispersal") through media 
- Reflection - When not viewing a light source directly, light must interact with objects for us to see it 
- Refraction (apparent bending) through media -longer wavelengths refract less 
- Diffraction ("bending")
- Absorption


## Spectrum 
- Spectrum describers the amount of light in different wavelengths 
- Shows how much light is emitted, reflected or transmitted from the target.
- how much of color the light contains 
- Normal representation of spectrum is a plot intensity VS Wavelength
- Spectral signature is unique for each material and cam be used to identify different materials.

### Spectral range
200 to 400 is UV
400 to 780 is VIS
