# Computer Vision 
- Goal of computer vision : precevie the "story" behind the picture.
- Computer properties of the world: Shapes, names, of people or objects, what happened?

- Make computers understand images and video. 
	- What kind of scene
	- where are the cars
	- how far is the building?
	- and so on...

## Human Vison
- The human eye is equipped with a verity of optical elements, including the cornea, iris, pupil, a variable lens and the retina.
- Can do many things
	- Recognize people and objects
	- Navigate through obstacles
	- Understand mood in the scene
	- Imagine stories 
		- The human eye can be fooled by illusions, ignore details, Ambiguous description of the world. Doesn't care about accuracy of the world.

## Can the computer match human perception?
- Yes and no (mainly no): computers can be better at easy things; humans are much better at hard things.
	- Challenges are different in each case.
- But huge progress has been made in the last years: what us i

- Aims to offer a similar, if not better, capability to a **machine** or **computer**, **Computer Vision** is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a singe image or a sequence of images. 

# Computer vision and nearby fields 
- Computer graphics: models to images
- Computational photography images to images 
- Computer vision: images to models

# Components of a computer vision system 

- Scene interpretation -> Computer -> Lighting 


# Computer Vision pipeline 

Image acquisition -> Pre-Processing -> Feature extraction -> Detection and segmentation -> High-level processing -> output -> Application 

# Fundamental Steps in Digital Images Processing / CV

1. Image acquisition
2. Colour image processing
3. Multimodal imaging 
4. Compression
5. Filtering and enhancement
6. Morphological operations
7. Feature extraction
8. Restoration 
9. Segmentation 
10. Classification 


# What are the challanges in computer vison

## cat?
- Images are Numbers
	- How to classify this image as a cat?
	- What features useful to identify this as a cat?

## pose variability

## interclass variability

## occlusion 

## Viewpoint variation 

## Illumination

## Scale 

## Shape and deformations

## Motion 

## Context 

## image segmentation 

## Image classification 

# Computer Vision Vs Human Vision
- Studied brain of cat
- Electrodes attached in the back of the cat brain
- Observed the primary visual cortex of cat brain 
- Recorded electrical activity from individual neurons in the brains of cats
- **Simple cells**
	- Response to light

# Block world
- Larry Roberts, 1963
- Work on a visual system that could divide picures into "likely objects" likely bacground areas, and chaos. This was the first application of artificial intelligence
