- Incident - A single or a series of unwanted or unexpected events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.

- Event - An identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of policy or failure of controls, or an unknown relevant situation.

- Asset - Anything that has value to the organization.

- Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. *NIST*

- Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an asset through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of service. *ENISA*

- A threat can be anything, whether physical or abstract, if it has the potential to adversely affect an object or system. *DS2020*


### Types of threat
- _Unconscious_ - Hurricanes, rain, accidents and mistakes.
- _Conscious_ - An actor is behind the threat.
- Attacks can originate from within an organization or from outside of the organization.
- *internal threats* 
	- Mishandle confidential data. 
	- Threaten the operations of servers or network devices
	- Facilitate attacks by connecting infected USB media.
	- Accidentally invite malware via malicious email or websites
- *External threats*
	-  External threats increase when you are connected
	- 5,4 billion potential attackers worldwide ([June'22](https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm))

### Threat actors
-   Opportunity
	 - Targetted actors: determined to find and exploit opportunities in a specific goal
	 - Stuxnet, Ukraine-Russia conflict
- Opportunistic, but later targeted
- Opportunistic: often interested in values they can obtain from more than one company, in the form of financial gain.
- Chaos actors: Not targeting their victims
	-  Wannacry.

#### Intention
- **Pure curiosity
- **Financially motivated
	- Extortion of ransom, CEO fraud.
- **Politically motivated
	- Spread a political message, against a specific issue.
- **State-motivated
	- Highest motives and highest privileges.

#### Capability
- **Advanced skills
	- Can develop very advanced tools and create exploits.
- **Generic, open access skills
	- Using available, open source tools.
	- Possible defense mechanisms to detect the tools used.
- **The gray zone
	- People with high capabilities choose low-quality tools.
	- People with low to average capabilities get advanced tools.

#### Categories
-  **Amateurs**, limited skills, use existing tools to attack.
	- Script kiddies - just curious, or try to demonstrate their skills.
-  **Hackers**, break into computers/networks to gain access.
	- White hats aim to discover weaknesses in the system.
		- They take prior permission and results are reported to the owner.
- **Black hats** take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.
- **Gray hats** are between white and black hat attackers.
	- Some may report the vulnerability to the owners, others publish it online so that other attackers can exploit it.

##### Organized hackers
- Cyber criminals - groups of professional criminals focused on control, power, and wealth.
	-  Highly sophisticated and organized, cybercrime as a service
- Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness to issues that are important to them.
- State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government.
	-  Espionage, sabotage
	-  Highly trained and well-funded
	-  Their attacks are focused on specific goals beneficial to their government.

### APT
- Threat actors.
- Prober tools and skills to practice a range of (advanced) techniques.
- Logistics and resources to exercise adaptability and persistence.
- Choose the attack vector in the easiest way possible.
