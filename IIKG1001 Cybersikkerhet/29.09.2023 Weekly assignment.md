## Week 39

### Lab Exercise

**Goals:**

1. Get familiar with the `gpg` command and the basics of encryption, hashing, and signatures.
2. Have fun! â˜º

**Introduction:**

This lab is intended to be completed on your SkyHigh Ubuntu VM. If the website for the encrypted files is inaccessible, they are also located on Blackboard in a zip file.

**GPG** stands for **GNU Privacy Guard** and is a free and open-source software tool used for data encryption and cryptographic security. It is primarily designed to provide privacy and security for data communication and storage.

Before starting, ensure that you are using a current version of GPG:

bash

`gpg --version`

The version should be 2.2 or newer.

If you do not have GPG installed:

- **Windows:** [Download GPG](https://gnupg.org/download/)
    
- **Mac:**
    
    bash
    

- `brew install gnupg`
    
- **Linux:**
    
    bash
    

- `sudo apt install gpg`
    

## **Task 1: Key management** 
a) Create your own GPG key 
b) Get `gaute.s.nogva@ntnu.no`'s key from keys.openpgp.org using CLI. 
c) (OPTIONAL) Upload your public key to keys.openpgp.org using CLI.

You will have to verify your e-mail address to ensure your fellow students can find your key. You do not have to upload your key if you do not want to share your e-mail address, but it will be required for an optional task later.

**Done**

## **Task 2: Using a digital signature** 
a) What are some reasons behind digital signatures? 
- To make sure the file is not tempered with and knowing who did it.
b) Verify that [lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt](http://lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt) is from 'Gaute Saastad Nogva', by using the detached signature [lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt.sig](http://lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt.sig). Hint: the wget command might be useful to fetch the files from the webserver. 


c) Create a new file and sign a file to prove it is from you. 
d) Based on what you have experienced in this task so far, what are the benefits of using a detached signature?

## **Task 3: Decrypt a file** 
a) Gaute has encrypted `secretMessage.txt.gpg` using AES256 symmetric encryption with the password 'BadPassword'. Decrypt the file to read the message. The file can be fetched from [lab39.gautesno.no/secretMessage.txt.gpg](http://lab39.gautesno.no/secretMessage.txt.gpg). 
b) What are some pros and cons of symmetric encryption? Feel free to research the topic and find your own sources.

## **Task 4: Encrypt a message** 
a) Using asymmetric encryption, encrypt a message intended for Gaute. 
b) What are some of the pros and cons of asymmetric encryption? Feel free to research the topic and find your own sources.

## **Task 5: Optional bonus task. Time to combine all you have learned.** 
Encrypt a file with a secret question using asymmetric encryption, send it to a fellow student, have them decrypt it and send you an encrypted relevant response which you decrypt to verify the message was decrypted and understood.
