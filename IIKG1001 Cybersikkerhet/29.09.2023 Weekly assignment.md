## Week 39

### Lab Exercise

**Goals:**

1. Get familiar with the `gpg` command and the basics of encryption, hashing, and signatures.
2. Have fun! â˜º

**Introduction:**

This lab is intended to be completed on your SkyHigh Ubuntu VM. If the website for the encrypted files is inaccessible, they are also located on Blackboard in a zip file.

**GPG** stands for **GNU Privacy Guard** and is a free and open-source software tool used for data encryption and cryptographic security. It is primarily designed to provide privacy and security for data communication and storage.

Before starting, ensure that you are using a current version of GPG:

bash

`gpg --version`

The version should be 2.2 or newer.

If you do not have GPG installed:

- **Windows:** [Download GPG](https://gnupg.org/download/)
    
- **Mac:**
    
    bash
    

- `brew install gnupg`
    
- **Linux:**
    
    bash
    

- `sudo apt install gpg`
    

## **Task 1: Key management** 
a) Create your own GPG key 
b) Get `gaute.s.nogva@ntnu.no`'s key from keys.openpgp.org using CLI. 
c) (OPTIONAL) Upload your public key to keys.openpgp.org using CLI.

You will have to verify your e-mail address to ensure your fellow students can find your key. You do not have to upload your key if you do not want to share your e-mail address, but it will be required for an optional task later.

**Done**

## **Task 2: Using a digital signature** 
a) What are some reasons behind digital signatures? 
- To make sure the file is not tempered with and knowing who did it.
b) Verify that [lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt](http://lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt) is from 'Gaute Saastad Nogva', by using the detached signature [lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt.sig](http://lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt.sig). Hint: the wget command might be useful to fetch the files from the webserver. 
- After getting the key i need to import it
	1. - `gpg --import "The Key you wanna impoty"
	2.  `gpg --verify signedFile.txt.sig signedFile.txt

c) Create a new file and sign a file to prove it is from you.
- `gpg --sign file1
d) Based on what you have experienced in this task so far, what are the benefits of using a detached signature?
	1. **Separation of Signature and Data:** With a detached signature, the signature itself is separate from the data it is verifying. This separation allows you to keep the original data intact without modifying it, which can be crucial in certain scenarios where the data should not be altered.
	    
2. **Versatility:** Detached signatures can be applied to various types of data, including files, documents, emails, and more. This versatility makes them suitable for different use cases, such as software distribution, document verification, and email authentication.
	    
	3. **Reduced Bandwidth:** When verifying a file's authenticity, only the detached signature needs to be transmitted or shared, not the entire data file. This can result in significant bandwidth savings, especially when verifying large files or distributing software updates.
	    
	4. **Selective Verification:** Users can choose when and where to verify the signature. They can decide to verify the signature only when needed, rather than verifying it every time they receive the data. This can save time and resources in situations where continuous verification is not required.
	    
	5. **Ease of Distribution:** Detached signatures are often distributed alongside the data they verify, making it convenient for recipients to verify the authenticity of the data without relying on a central authority.
	    
	6. **Maintains Data Privacy:** Detached signatures do not expose the content of the data being signed. Only the signature itself and the public key are needed for verification, preserving the privacy and confidentiality of the data.
	    
	7. **Interoperability:** Detached signatures are commonly used in various cryptographic and security standards, making them compatible with different software and systems that support digital signatures.

## **Task 3: Decrypt a file** 
a) Gaute has encrypted `secretMessage.txt.gpg` using AES256 symmetric encryption with the password 'BadPassword'. Decrypt the file to read the message. The file can be fetched from [lab39.gautesno.no/secretMessage.txt.gpg](http://lab39.gautesno.no/secretMessage.txt.gpg). 
- The msg was This is the secret message.
b) What are some pros and cons of symmetric encryption? Feel free to research the topic and find your own sources.
- 

## **Task 4: Encrypt a message** 
a) Using asymmetric encryption, encrypt a message intended for Gaute. 
b) What are some of the pros and cons of asymmetric encryption? Feel free to research the topic and find your own sources.

## **Task 5: Optional bonus task. Time to combine all you have learned.** 
Encrypt a file with a secret question using asymmetric encryption, send it to a fellow student, have them decrypt it and send you an encrypted relevant response which you decrypt to verify the message was decrypted and understood.
