**Task 1**
Answer each of the following questions:
1. What is NOT a solution to address the issues of limited IPv4 addresses?
   a. Supernetting
   b. Subnetting
   c. CIDR
   d. NAT
   
*Answer:. D* (**NAT: Network Address Translation**)
NAT is not a solution to address the issues of limited IPv4 addresses. Instead, NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IPv4 address for accessing resources on the internet. It does not create more IPv4 addresses but rather conserves them by allowing multiple devices to use the same public address. Supernetting, subnetting, and CIDR are techniques that help manage and allocate existing IPv4 addresses more efficiently, but they don't create new addresses.

2. What is the problem with Classful Addressing?
   a. Address allocation is unreliable
   b. Address allocation is inefficient
   c. Address allocation is unsafe
   d. Address allocation is inflexible
   
   *Answer:. B*
   The problem with Classful Addressing is that it is inefficient in terms of address allocation. Classful addressing divides the available IPv4 address space into fixed classes (Class A, Class B, and Class C), each with a predetermined number of network and host bits. This rigid allocation scheme often leads to inefficient use of IP addresses because organizations may be allocated more addresses than they actually need (wasting addresses) or not enough addresses (resulting in address shortages).

3. ______ is to break an IP address space into several smaller spaces.
   a. Supernetting
   b. DHCP
   c. Subnetting
   d. IP
   
   *Answer:. C*
   Subnetting is the process of breaking an IP address space into several smaller subnetworks (subnets) to create a more efficient and organized network infrastructure. It allows an organization to allocate IP addresses based on its specific needs and helps with network management and routing efficiency.

4. is used to automatically assign an IP address to a computer when it connects to a network.
   a. IP
   b. DHCP
   c. Switch
   d. Router
   
   *Answer:. B (Dynamic Host Configuration protocol)*
   DHCP is used to automatically assign an IP address to a computer when it connects to a network. It simplifies network administration by dynamically managing the allocation of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network, eliminating the need for manual IP address assignments.

5.  is responsible for mapping private IP addresses to one public IP address.
   a. NAT
   b. IP
   c. ARP
   d. DHCP
   
   *Answer:. A*
   NAT (Network Address Translation) is responsible for mapping private IP addresses to one public IP address. It allows multiple devices on a local network with private IP addresses to share a single public IP address when accessing resources on the internet. NAT is commonly used to conserve public IPv4 addresses and improve network security by hiding internal network structures from external entities.

6. depends on port numbers to build one-to-one mapping between private IP addresses and public IP addresses.
   a. Transport layer of the TCP/IP model
   b. Port Address Translation (PAT)
   c. ARP
   d. DHCP
   
   *Answer:. B (Port Address Translation)*
   Port Address Translation (PAT) depends on port numbers to build a one-to-one mapping between private IP addresses and a single public IP address. It's a specific form of Network Address Translation (NAT) that uses port numbers to differentiate between multiple internal devices sharing the same public IP address. PAT allows multiple devices on a private network to communicate with the internet using the same public IP address by mapping their private IP addresses to unique port numbers.

**Task 2**
Answer each of the following questions:
1. Which of the following IP address is a valid CIDR notation?
   a. 128.123.22.2\1
   b. 128.123.22.2-16
   c. 128.123.22.2/24
   d. 128.123.22.2(29)
   
   *Answer:. C*
	The / says it is a CIDR format

2. What does "/24" mean in "192.168.110.13/24"?
   a. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.255
   b. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
   c. A subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
   d. A subnet mask of 192.168.110.0
   
   *Answer:. B.*
   In the notation "192.168.110.13/24," the "/24" indicates the subnet mask. Specifically, it represents a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used for host addresses within that subnet.

3. What does "/8" mean in "50.168.110.13/8"?
   a. A subnet mask of 255.0.0.0
   b. A subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
   c. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
   d. A subnet mask of 50.0.0.0
   
   *Answer:. A*
   In the notation "50.168.110.13/8," the "/8" indicates the subnet mask. Specifically, it represents a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0. This means that the first 8 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, and the remaining 24 bits are used for host addresses within that subnet. This is often referred to as a Class A network, where the first octet (8 bits) defines the network and the remaining three octets (24 bits) are available for hosts.

4. What is the net ID of "200.122.110.13/24"?
   a. 200.122.110.10
   b. 200.122.0.0
   c. 200.122.110.0
   d. 200.0.0.0
   
   *Answer:. C*
   In the IP address "200.122.110.13/24," the "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion. So, the network ID is "200.122.110.0," and the host portion can vary within that network.

5. What is the net ID of "40.122.110.13/8"?
   a. 40.0.0.0
   b. 40.122.0.0
   c. 40.122.110.0
   d. 40.122.110.13
   
   *Answer:. A*
   In the IP address "40.122.110.13/8," the "/8" indicates that the first 8 bits are used for the network portion. So, the network ID is "40.0.0.0," and the remaining 24 bits are available for host addresses within that network.

6. What is the host ID of "200.150.110.13/24"?
   a. .110.13
   b. .150.110.13
   c. .13
   d. .24
   
   *Answer:. C*
   In the IP address "200.150.110.13/24," the "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host portion. Therefore, the host ID is ".13."

7. What is the host ID of "100.150.100.134/8"?
   a. .100.134
   b. .150.100.134
   c. .134
   d. .8
   
   *Answer:. B*
  I apologize for any confusion. In the IP address "100.150.100.134/8," the "/8" indicates that the first 8 bits are used for the network portion. Therefore, the host ID is ".150.100.134."

8. What is the subnet mask of a /28 network?
   a. 255.255.255.240
   b. 255.255.254.0
   c. 255.255.255.254
   d. 255.255.255.224

*Answer:. A*
When working with CIDR notation, the number following the slash (/) indicates how many bits are used for the network portion of the subnet mask. In this case, a /28 network uses the first 28 bits for the network portion, leaving 4 bits for the host portion.

**Task 3**
Answer each of the following questions:
1. How many subnets will be generated by extending a net ID from 8 bits to 11 bits?
	When you extend the network ID portion from 8 bits to 11 bits, you are borrowing 3 additional bits for subnetting. Each additional bit can double the number of subnets.

	With 8 bits, you have 2^8 = 256 possible combinations (from 0 to 255) for the network ID. When you extend it to 11 bits, you have 2^11 = 2048 possible combinations for the network ID.

	To calculate how many subnets are generated, subtract the original number of subnets (256) from the new number of subnets (2048):

	**2048 - 256 = 1792**


2. How many subnets will be generated by extending a net ID from 24 bits to 29 bits?
	A net id from 24 is 1 as this is a single subnet so it will be 2^29-1
	so it will be **2^29-1=536870911*

3. By taking 4 bits from the original host ID part, ___ subnetworks can be created.
	**i would be able to create 16 subnetworks. 

4. By taking 6 bits from the original host ID part, ___ subnetworks can be created.
	**i would be able to create 64 subnets**

5. How many subnets does a network of "50.250.180.0/13" provide?
   to calculate this we can take a full subnet that is 2^32 and minus it on the size we provide, so it would be **2^(32-13) = 524288**

6. How many subnets does a network of 190.250.180.0 with a subnet mask of "/19" provide?
	we do the same as in 5 **2^(32-19) = 8192**

7. A /27 CIDR block provides  assignable IP addresses.
	*192.168.1.223/27 gives 32 Ip addresses to be assigned* 

8. A /9 CIDR block provides ______ assignable IP addresses.
   *with CIDR /9 gives us 8388608 IP addresses to be assigned*

**Task 4**
Answer the following questions:
1. What is the CIDR notation of subnet mask 255.224.0.0?
   **that gives a CIDR /11** because the first 8 bits is set to 1 and the next part is set to 11100000 so 
   8+3 = 11

2. What is the decimal form and CIDR notation of subnet mask 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000?
   **255.255.240.0**
   **255.255.240.0/20**

**Task 5**
Answer the following questions:
1. Are the following two IP addresses in the same network?
   - 128.143.137.32/26
     10000000.10001111.10001000.00*010000*
     11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
   - 128.143.137.144/26
     10000000.10001111.10001000.10*010000*
     11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
     Yes they are on the same network 

2. Are the following two IP addresses in the same network?
   - 128.143.137.32/23
     10000000.10001111.10001000.00*010000*
     11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000
   - 128.143.137.144/23
     10000000.10001111.10001000.10*010000*
     11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000
     No they are not on the same network when you take the CIDR in consideration. 

**Task 6**
Do you know how to find your public IP addresses on your laptop, smartphone, and tablet?
Do you know how to find your private IP addresses on your different devices?
Read here and practice.
Note:
- On Windows, you may also use the command “ipconfig” to find out your address info.
- On Mac OS or Linux distributions, you can use commands “ip” or “ifconfig”.
- Here you can see the differences between “ipconfig” and “ifconfig”.
  *To see the IP address on my laptop i can open CMD and just use `ipconfig -all` or just `ipconfig`*

**Task 7**
In what scenario do your devices share the same public IP address while having different private IP addresses? Can you explain?
When you are on a LAN you have one public IP but a private table for private IP addresses for all home devices is the most common happening. 

**Task 8**
1. What is the difference between the execution result of the command “ip a” and command “ip link”?
   i don't get a IP address when i use link.
   In summary, the main difference is that "ip a" provides information about IP addresses assigned to network interfaces, while "ip link" provides information about the network interfaces themselves, including their names and MAC addresses, without focusing on IP configuration. These commands are often used together to get a comprehensive view of network configuration on a Linux system.

2. What does “lo” mean? What is the function of IP address “127.0.0.1”? Google the answer if you are unsure.
   lo means local.
   Localhost is the default name of the computer you are working on. The term is a pseudo name for 127.0. 0.1, **the IP address of the local computer**. This IP address allows the machine to connect to and communicate with itself.

3. How can you see the IP address associated with each of your network interfaces?
   on a Linux system you use the command `ip a`, `ip addr` or `ip address`
   on a Windows system you can just use `ipconfig` or `ipconfig -all`
   
4. How can you know the MAC address associated with your network interfaces?
   on a Windows system you can again just use `ipconfig -all` and it tells you the Mac address on the preferred network device WiFi or Cable. 

5. How can you know if your network interfaces are up and running?
   you can always try to ping a service you know is always up like vg.no, using the command `ping vg.no`

6. How do you know the IPv6 address of your network interfaces?
   on a Windows system you again just type `ipconfig -all` and you get to see it
   on a Linux system you use `ip -6 addr`.

**Task 9**
Now try to use the command “ip” to view all the routes on that virtual machine. Can you explain all the routes?
on my vm when i lookup with the ip command i get 2 drives the local network and the one that is connected to the internet, i know this based on the ip and that i can ping a site outside the network.

**Task 11**
In this task, we are going to be using the dig and nslookup commands to gather information about the domain ntnu.no.
Use nslookup or dig to answer the following questions:
1. What is the A record of “ntnu.no”? Note that the “A” stands for Address.
	127.0.0.53#53

	1. What is the MX of “ntnu.no”?
	   ntnu.no mail exchanger = 10 mx.ntnu.no.
   

3. What is the function of the NS record (or nameserver record)?
	In summary, *NS (Name Server)* records are essential components of the DNS that specify the authoritative name servers for a domain. They enable the delegation of subdomains, facilitate the hierarchical structure of the DNS, provide redundancy and fault tolerance, and support load balancing. These records are crucial for the proper functioning of the DNS system and the accurate resolution of domain names to IP addresses.

4. What is the difference between a pointer (PTR) record and an A record?
	In summary, the main difference is in their direction of mapping:

	- **A Record**: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address (forward resolution).
	- **PTR Record**: Maps an IPv4 address to a domain name (reverse resolution).

	Both types of records are essential for different aspects of DNS functionality, with A records used for regular DNS lookups and PTR records used for reverse DNS lookups.

5. Use reverse DNS lookup on 129.241.78.12. What is the domain name of this IP address?
   The Norwegian University & Research Network.
