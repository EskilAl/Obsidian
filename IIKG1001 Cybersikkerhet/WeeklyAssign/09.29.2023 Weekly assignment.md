## Week 39

### Lab Exercise

**Goals:**

1. Get familiar with the `gpg` command and the basics of encryption, hashing, and signatures.
2. Have fun! â˜º

**Introduction:**

This lab is intended to be completed on your SkyHigh Ubuntu VM. If the website for the encrypted files is inaccessible, they are also located on Blackboard in a zip file.

**GPG** stands for **GNU Privacy Guard** and is a free and open-source software tool used for data encryption and cryptographic security. It is primarily designed to provide privacy and security for data communication and storage.

Before starting, ensure that you are using a current version of GPG:

bash

`gpg --version`

The version should be 2.2 or newer.

If you do not have GPG installed:

- **Windows:** [Download GPG](https://gnupg.org/download/)
    
- **Mac:**
    
    bash
    

- `brew install gnupg`
    
- **Linux:**
    
    bash
    

- `sudo apt install gpg`
    

## **Task 1: Key management** 
a) Create your own GPG key 
b) Get `gaute.s.nogva@ntnu.no`'s key from keys.openpgp.org using CLI. 
c) (OPTIONAL) Upload your public key to keys.openpgp.org using CLI.

You will have to verify your e-mail address to ensure your fellow students can find your key. You do not have to upload your key if you do not want to share your e-mail address, but it will be required for an optional task later.

**Done**

## **Task 2: Using a digital signature** 
a) What are some reasons behind digital signatures? 
- To make sure the file is not tempered with and knowing who did it.
b) Verify that [lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt](http://lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt) is from 'Gaute Saastad Nogva', by using the detached signature [lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt.sig](http://lab39.gautesno.no/signedFile.txt.sig). Hint: the wget command might be useful to fetch the files from the webserver. 
- After getting the key i need to import it
	1. - `gpg --import "The Key you wanna impoty"
	2.  `gpg --verify signedFile.txt.sig signedFile.txt

c) Create a new file and sign a file to prove it is from you.
- `gpg --sign file1
d) Based on what you have experienced in this task so far, what are the benefits of using a detached signature?
	1. **Separation of Signature and Data:** With a detached signature, the signature itself is separate from the data it is verifying. This separation allows you to keep the original data intact without modifying it, which can be crucial in certain scenarios where the data should not be altered.
	    
2. **Versatility:** Detached signatures can be applied to various types of data, including files, documents, emails, and more. This versatility makes them suitable for different use cases, such as software distribution, document verification, and email authentication.
	    
	3. **Reduced Bandwidth:** When verifying a file's authenticity, only the detached signature needs to be transmitted or shared, not the entire data file. This can result in significant bandwidth savings, especially when verifying large files or distributing software updates.
	    
	4. **Selective Verification:** Users can choose when and where to verify the signature. They can decide to verify the signature only when needed, rather than verifying it every time they receive the data. This can save time and resources in situations where continuous verification is not required.
	    
	5. **Ease of Distribution:** Detached signatures are often distributed alongside the data they verify, making it convenient for recipients to verify the authenticity of the data without relying on a central authority.
	    
	6. **Maintains Data Privacy:** Detached signatures do not expose the content of the data being signed. Only the signature itself and the public key are needed for verification, preserving the privacy and confidentiality of the data.
	    
	7. **Interoperability:** Detached signatures are commonly used in various cryptographic and security standards, making them compatible with different software and systems that support digital signatures.

## **Task 3: Decrypt a file** 
a) Gaute has encrypted `secretMessage.txt.gpg` using AES256 symmetric encryption with the password 'BadPassword'. Decrypt the file to read the message. The file can be fetched from [lab39.gautesno.no/secretMessage.txt.gpg](http://lab39.gautesno.no/secretMessage.txt.gpg). 
- The msg was This is the secret message.
b) What are some pros and cons of symmetric encryption? Feel free to research the topic and find your own sources.
1. **Speed and Efficiency:** Symmetric encryption algorithms are typically faster and computationally more efficient than asymmetric encryption algorithms. This makes them suitable for encrypting and decrypting large volumes of data quickly.
    
2. **Simplicity:** Symmetric encryption is straightforward to implement and understand. It involves fewer complexities in key management compared to asymmetric encryption, which requires managing public and private key pairs.
    
3. **Less Processing Power:** Since symmetric encryption is computationally less intensive, it is often preferred for resource-constrained devices such as IoT devices and embedded systems.
    
4. **Suitable for Bulk Data:** Symmetric encryption is well-suited for encrypting bulk data, such as files and disk partitions, due to its efficiency.
    
5. **Strong Security:** When used with long, randomly generated keys, symmetric encryption can provide strong security. Popular symmetric encryption algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are considered highly secure when configured correctly.
    

**Cons of Symmetric Encryption:**

1. **Key Distribution:** One of the primary challenges of symmetric encryption is key distribution. The sender and receiver must securely share the same encryption key. If an attacker intercepts the key during transmission, the security of the communication can be compromised.
    
2. **Key Management:** In scenarios where multiple parties need to communicate securely, managing and distributing encryption keys to all parties can be complex and may require a trusted third party.
    
3. **Lack of Forward Secrecy:** Symmetric encryption does not provide forward secrecy, which means that if the encryption key is compromised at any point in the past or present, all previously encrypted data is also at risk.
    
4. **Scalability:** Symmetric encryption can be challenging to scale in large, dynamic environments where frequent key changes are needed, such as in a public key infrastructure (PKI).
    
5. **Limited Use for Secure Communication:** Symmetric encryption is often used in combination with asymmetric encryption in secure communication protocols. Asymmetric encryption is used to securely exchange symmetric encryption keys, addressing some of the key distribution issues, but adding complexity.
    
6. **No Digital Signatures:** Symmetric encryption alone does not provide a means of digitally signing data to ensure its authenticity and integrity. This functionality is typically achieved using asymmetric encryption and digital signatures.

## **Task 4: Encrypt a message** 
a) Using asymmetric encryption, encrypt a message intended for Gaute. 
- `gpg -c textToGaute.txt`
b) What are some of the pros and cons of asymmetric encryption? Feel free to research the topic and find your own sources.
1. **Key Distribution Simplicity:** Asymmetric encryption simplifies the process of key distribution compared to symmetric encryption. Users only need to share their public keys, which can be freely distributed.
    
2. **Enhanced Security:** Asymmetric encryption provides a higher level of security in terms of key exchange and confidentiality. Even if the public key is known, it is computationally infeasible to derive the private key from it.
    
3. **Digital Signatures:** Asymmetric encryption facilitates the creation of digital signatures, which can verify the authenticity and integrity of data. Digital signatures are crucial for authentication and data integrity in secure communication.
    
4. **Forward Secrecy:** Asymmetric encryption inherently provides forward secrecy. Even if an attacker compromises the private key at a later time, previously encrypted data remains secure because it was encrypted with a different key.
    
5. **Key Management:** There is no need for secure key exchange between parties before communication. Users can simply share their public keys, reducing the complexity of key management.
    

**Cons of Asymmetric Encryption:**

1. **Slower Processing:** Asymmetric encryption algorithms are computationally more intensive than symmetric encryption algorithms. This can lead to slower encryption and decryption processes, which may not be suitable for encrypting large volumes of data.
    
2. **Key Size:** Public and private keys used in asymmetric encryption are longer than symmetric keys, which can result in larger data sizes and increased computational overhead.
    
3. **Limited Use for Bulk Data:** Due to its computational overhead, asymmetric encryption is less efficient for encrypting bulk data, such as files or disk partitions. It is typically used to secure symmetric encryption keys or small amounts of data.
    
4. **Key Management Complexity:** While key distribution is simplified, managing a large number of public keys in a public key infrastructure (PKI) can be complex. Revoking compromised keys and certificate management are challenging tasks.
    
5. **Dependence on Trust:** Asymmetric encryption relies on trust in the public keys of others. If a public key is compromised or belongs to an untrustworthy entity, it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    
6. **No Secrecy Amplification:** Asymmetric encryption does not provide secrecy amplification, which means that if the private key is compromised, all previously encrypted data is also at risk.

## **Task 5: Optional bonus task. Time to combine all you have learned.** 
Encrypt a file with a secret question using asymmetric encryption, send it to a fellow student, have them decrypt it and send you an encrypted relevant response which you decrypt to verify the message was decrypted and understood.
