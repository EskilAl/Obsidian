**Task 1**
Answer each of the following questions:
1. Write down the 7 layers in the OSI model from the top to the bottom.
	1. Physical
	2. Data Link
	3. Network
	4. Transport 
	5. Session 
	6. Presentation
	7. Application

 2. What actions are required to move data from the application layer to the physical layer of the OSI model on a sending computer?	   
	   data moves from the application layer to the physical layer by passing through each of the lower layers, where headers, addressing, and other necessary information are added to the original data, and it is eventually converted into the appropriate physical signals for transmission over the network. This process ensures that data is properly encapsulated and prepared for its journey across the network.
   
3. What actions are required to move data from the physical layer to the application layer of the OSI model on a receiving computer?
	   the process involves the reverse of the encapsulation and processing that occurred during data transmission. The data is gradually stripped of the headers and processing applied in the lower layers until it reaches the application layer in a format that the receiving application can interpret and utilize.
   
3. What does process-to-process communication mean?
	Process-to-process communication refers to the exchange of data or information between two software processes or applications running on separate devices or within the same device's operating system. In this context, a "process" typically refers to an independent, executing program or task that has its own memory space and resources.
   
4. What information is required to achieve process-to-process communication?
   Achieving process-to-process communication, especially in a networked environment, requires several key pieces of information and parameters to ensure that data is correctly routed and delivered to the intended destination.
   
5. What are the port ranges for the well-known ports, registered ports, and dynamic ports?
   TCP and UDP communication, ports are categorized into three main ranges: well-known ports, registered ports, and dynamic (or private) ports. These port ranges are defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to help organize and manage the allocation of ports for different services and applications. Here are the typical port ranges for each category:

	1. **Well-Known Ports (0-1023)**:
	    
	    - Port numbers in the range of 0 to 1023 are reserved for well-known or system services. These ports are standardized and used for widely recognized services and protocols. Some examples include:
	        - Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
	        - Port 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
	        - Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
	        - Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell)
	        - Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System)
	2. **Registered Ports (1024-49151)**:
	    
	    - Port numbers in the range of 1024 to 49151 are assigned by IANA to software applications and services that are not as widely recognized as those in the well-known range but still require standardized port assignments. These ports are often used by various applications and services that are not part of the core internet protocols. Some examples include:
	        - Port 1433: Microsoft SQL Server
	        - Port 3306: MySQL Database
	        - Port 5432: PostgreSQL Database
	        - Port 8080: HTTP proxy or alternative web server port
	3. **Dynamic (or Private) Ports (49152-65535)**:
	    
	    - Port numbers in the range of 49152 to 65535 are reserved for dynamic or private use. These ports are available for use by applications, services, or processes on a temporary or ad-hoc basis. They are typically used for client-side applications when initiating connections to well-known or registered ports on remote servers. Dynamic ports are assigned by the operating system's TCP/IP stack as needed.
	      
6. Which port range can be freely used by network applications?
	The port range that can be freely used by network applications is the range of **dynamic ports** or **private ports**, which typically includes port numbers from **49152 to 65535**. These ports are also known as "ephemeral ports" or "high ports."
	
7. Why does each network device on the Internet need to have a unique IP address?
	   unique IP addresses are the foundation of the internet's communication and routing system. They allow for accurate identification of devices, efficient routing of data, end-to-end communication, security, and the hosting of services. Without unique IP addresses, the internet as we know it would not function effectively.
	   
8. Why does each device on a network segment need to have a unique physical address?
	   unique physical addresses (MAC addresses) for devices within a network segment are essential for local communication, address resolution, network management, and ensuring that data is delivered accurately to the intended recipient. They play a crucial role in the functioning and organization of data link layer communication within a local network.
	   
9. Will a network device’s physical address change if it is moved to another location?
	   A network device's physical address, typically represented by its Media Access Control (MAC) address, does not change when the device is moved to another location. The MAC address is hard-coded into the network interface card (NIC) or the network adapter of the device when it is manufactured. It serves as a unique identifier for the device's network interface.
	   
10. What protocols does a web browser on a wireless network need to communicate with a remote HTTP web server?
	    When a web browser on a wireless network communicates with a remote HTTP web server, several protocols and technologies come into play to enable this interaction. These protocols work together to ensure that web pages and content are retrieved and displayed correctly
	    
11. What protocols does an FTP client on a wired network need to communicate with a remote FTP server?
	    an FTP client on a wired network primarily uses FTP, TCP, and IP protocols for communication with a remote FTP server. It establishes a control channel on port 21 for command and response exchanges and may dynamically allocate data channels for actual file transfers. Additionally, authentication and security protocols like FTPS or SFTP may be used to enhance the security of file transfers.

2. Open the terminal on your own computer, type command “ping www.google.com”
3. Wait for a few seconds and then exit the ping command by pressing Ctrl+c.
4. Stop the traffic capture by clicking on the stop button on Wireshark.
5. Type “icmp” in the display filter field to display all captured icmp packets only.
6. You should see icmp packets shown on the packet list pane as below.
