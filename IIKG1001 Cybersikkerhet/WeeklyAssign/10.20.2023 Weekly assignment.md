### Task 1

Watch these two videos about symmetric and asymmetric encryption with OpenSSL:

- [Symmetric Encryption With OpenSSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9TzPneXgkQ&t=53s)
- [Asymmetric Encryption With OpenSSL (Private Key & Public Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jE_UOiFAVw)
  
  **DONE

Documentation for OpenSSL:

- [OpenSSL Documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man1/openssl.html)
- [OpenSSL Man Page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man1/)

### Task 2

Watch this video about how to spot and avoid scam websites: [Scam Website Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAbp_ajsCco)

There are three possible icons (show below) you might see on the address bar of a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome). What does each of these icons mean? Please google the answer.
![[Pasted image 20231020114028.png]]

1. the Lock means that the website is secured with SSL encryption, indicating that this site is safe.
2. The exclamation mark informs the user that the site is still using HTTP, and not HTTPS so it is not encrypted. 
3. this site has expired security certificate or malicious code 
### Task 3

#### OpenSSL - Symmetric key – Encryption/decryption

1. Use the OpenSSL command-line tool to generate a random symmetric key using key size length of 128. Name the file "symmetric.key".
	   `openssl rand -out symmetric.key 128
	   
2. Create a text file and name it "clear_text.txt". Write something readable inside the file, e.g., "hello 123". Now, encrypt the file using the symmetric key you just generated and AES-256(Advanced Encryption Standard), name the encrypted file: "encrypted_text". Check the encrypted file. Is the message still readable?
   `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in clear_text.txt -out encrypted_txt -kfile symmetric.key
    
3. Now decrypt the newly created file using the symmetric key. Name this new encrypted file: "decrypted_text". Check the decrypted file. Is it readable? Is it the same as in "clear_text.txt" file?
    `openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encrypted_txt -out decrypted_txt -kfile symmetric.key 

### Task 4

#### OpenSSL – Asymmetric key – Encryption/decryption

1. Private key a. Use the OpenSSL command-line tool to generate a private key. Name it "private_key.pem".
   `openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -out private_key.pem
2. Public key a. Use the private key to generate the public key. Name this key "public_key.pem".
    `openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem`
3. Use the file "clear_text.txt" from Task 3. Encrypt it using pkeyutl and the public key you just generated and name the newly encrypted file: "encrypted_text2.enc". Check the encrypted file. Is it still readable?
`openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public_key.pem -in clear_text.txt -out encrypted_text2.enc
4. Now decrypt the newly created file using the private key. Name this new encrypted file: "decrypted_text2". Check the decrypted file. Is it readable? Is it the same as in "clear_text.txt" file?
 `openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private_key.pem -in encrypted_text2.enc -out decrypted_text2   

### Task 5

#### OpenSSL – Digital signature – Verify

1. Using the private key generated in Task 4, generate a digital signature for the file "file_sign.txt" and name the signature "signature.sig".
    `openssl dgst -sign private_key.pem -out signature.sig -sha256 file_sign.txt

2. Verify the signature "signature.sig" to see if file "file_sign.txt" is authentic and intact or not with the public key used in Task 4.
    `openssl dgst -verify public_key.pem -signature signature.sig -sha256 file_sign.txt
3. Generate a new public key (remember to generate a new private key first) and try to verify "file_sign.txt". Is it working?
    

### Task 6

Watch this video to know how VPN works: [VPN Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wQTRMBAvzg) (around 4 min).

Write down all possible benefits of using VPN.

### Task 7

Read the following description to learn how to use SFTP to securely transfer files.

SFTP, which stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a protocol packaged with SSH that works similar to FTP but over a secure connection. The advantage is the ability to leverage a secure connection to transfer files and traverse the filesystem on both the local and remote system.

By default, SFTP uses the SSH protocol to authenticate and establish a secure connection. Although passwords are easy to use and set up by default, we recommend you create SSH keys and transfer your public key to any system that you need to access. This is much more secure and can save you time in the long run.

If you can connect to the machine using SSH, then you have completed all of the necessary requirements necessary to use SFTP to manage files. In your cases, you are able to SSH to your Skyhigh virtual machines, meaning that you can naturally use SFTP to transfer files between your virtual machine and local computer.

You can establish an SFTP session by issuing the following command:

`sftp -i your_Private_key_file ubuntu@your_VM_floating_ip`

For example, in my case, what I need to type is shown below. Remember to first connect to NTNU VPN before you issue your command.
![[Pasted image 20231020114209.png]]

If you see "sftp>" (which is a SFTP prompt) on your terminal, meaning you have connected to your VM. If you need to know what you can do with the SFTP command, type either "help" or "?".

You can navigate through the remote system’s file hierarchy using a number of commands that function similarly to their shell counterparts. For examples, pwd, ls, and cd.

You can also navigate your file hierarchy on your local machine using commands "lpwd", "lls", and "lcd". Note that these commands are prefixed with the letter 'l' to indicate "local".

#### How to transfer remote files to the Local machine?

If you would like to download files from the remote machine, you can do so by issuing the following command:

arduino

`get remoteFileName`

By default, the "get" command downloads the remote file to a file with the same name in your local working directory. If you want to download the file and save it as another name, you can type the following command:

arduino

`get remoteFileName localFileName`

To download a directory, the option 'r' is required.
![[Pasted image 20231020114312.png]]
To download a directory, option ‘r’ is required. See the following example.
![[Pasted image 20231020114330.png]]
#### How to transfer local files to the remote machine?

Transferring local files to the remote machine can be done by the "put" command.

`put localFileName`

The same options that work with the "get" command apply to the "put" command.

### Task 8

After you are done with the previous task, answer the following questions.

1. What is the difference between commands "pwd" and "lpwd"?
2. What is the command to download your remote file "test.txt" without changing the filename? In which local directory will the file be saved by default?
3. What is the command to upload your local file "test.txt" and rename it as "testcopy.txt" to your remote working directory?
4. What is the command to download the "dir" directory that is under your remote working directory to your local working directory?

This is the end of this lab exercise. Hope you have enjoyed it and learned a lot.
