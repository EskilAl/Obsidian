# IIKG1001

## Week 45

### Lab exercise

#### Goals:
1. Understand two-factor authentication
2. Become familiar with basic access control management using getfacl and setfacl

	Description:

	In this week’s lab, you will learn what two-factor authentication is and why we need it. You will also become familiar with getfacl and setfacl commands, and what makes them different to the ls -l command.

	After finishing the tasks, you may work on the group assignment.

# Installation

_sudo apt update_

_sudo apt install acl_

# Commands

Today’s Linux commands are getfacl and setfacl. To learn more about them, read the manual page on your SkyHigh VM.

# Resources

-          ACL: [https://youtu.be/aIIgtFmWfzo](https://youtu.be/aIIgtFmWfzo)

  

# Exercises: Recap

1. What Linux command lets you see file permissions?
   ls -l or ls -la

2. What Linux command lets you modify file permissions?
   -chmod u+rw filename, or chmod u-rw

5. Create a new file “labWeek45.txt”. Change its permissions to the following bits:
	-rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Nov  5 11:00 labWeek45.txt

Try using both octal number and symbolic representation. Remember to check your result using the command from exercise 1.

# Exercises: Two-factor Authentication (2FA)

4. Two-factor authentication secures the user’s accounts from unwanted access by adding an additional layer of authentication. This comes on top of password login. What security benefits does this additional layer provide?

5. According to the ACL video, what two methods of authentication do we use?

6. In addition to using a password, what other authentication methods can we use to implement two-factor authentication?

# Exercise: Access Control List (ACL)

7. What benefits do getfacl and setfacl provide over the command from exercise 1 and 2?

8. Using the command from exercise 1, how do we know whether the file has additional permissions?

9a. Open the file with nano:

nano labWeek45.txt

Enter the following: “This week’s lab is about 2FA and ACL”. Save and nano.

9b. Create a new user called John.

9c. Change to John’s user and read the file’s content.
