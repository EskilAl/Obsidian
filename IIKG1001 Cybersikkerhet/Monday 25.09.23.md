## Summary 
- Cyber + security 
- Cyber -> Kyber 
- Includes measures for protection against real and potential threats that are channeled via ICT infrastructure.
- Subcategory of ICT security
- Locally, closely


### There is a large number of visits to a company's website. Which security principle is affected 
- Availability

### When we talk about values, attitudes, norms, assumptions, etc. that people use when dealing with digital assets, we are simply talking about: 
- Security culture.

## Introduction to Cybersecurity
- Everyone using digital devices is exposed
	- Criminals break into systems to steal information they can sell

- **Example**:
	- Every year, many Norwegian will receive fake e-mails and text messages when the tax return and tax settlement are sent out. By clicking on an attachment


## security 
- Security is defined as a condition with the absence of undesirable event, fear and danger.
	- Includes measures that contribute to this condition.
	- One will never have a total absence of unwanted incidents, dear and danger, but we should aim to reduce theses to an acceptable level.
	- Security is also about risk.
		- **Example**:
		- An inexperienced climber without security is exposed.
	- If a company fails to secure the ICT systems needed for its daily activities, something bad might happen.
		- Criminals are constantly searching for vulnerabilities. 
	- Assets, threats and vulnerabilities -key concepts in risk.
		- Asset: ICT systems.
		- Threats: People who try to break into data.
		- Vulnerability's: security holes in the ICT system.

## Digital security
- The criminals exploit both human and technological vulnerability's.
- Digital security is about measures that protect against both of them.
	- **Definition**:


## Information security 
- Includes both information in & out ICT system.
- An information system is defined as hardware, software and related services.
	- Used similarly with ICT systems.
- Digital security contributes to information security.

## History of information security 
- Computer Security
- Enigma
- ARPANET
- Rand Report R-609
- Internet
- Cyberwar

## A bit of (recent) history
- computer security
- information security
- it security

## Cybersecurity definition(s)
3 categories of definitions
- industry
- Government
- Academic
	**Best definition**
	- Collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management, approaches, actions, training, best practices assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and it's assets.
- The connected information network, an integral part of out daily lives.
- All types of organizations use this network to operate efficiently.
- **Confidentiality integrity and availability**

## CIA triad
### Cybersecurity principles
- CIA triad
	- the industry standard since the mainframes
- the standard is based on the characteristics that describe the utility information


## Confidentiality
- Confidentiality - that the information is not made known to unauthorized persons
- Information has **Confidentiality** when it is protected from disclosure or exposure to unauthorized individuals or system.
- Ensures that only users with the rights, privileges, and need to access information are able to do so.
- Confidentiality measures
	- Information classification
	- Secure document storage
	- Application of general security polices 
	- Education of information custodians and end users.
- Closely related to Privacy
	- Interdependent with other characteristics
- A high level is needed for personal information (PII).

## Integrity
- Integrity - that the information is not changed unintentionally or by unauthorized persons. 
- information has integrity when it is whole, complete, and uncorrupted. 

## Availability
- Availability - that the information is available to authorized persons when needed.
- Availability enables authorized users to access information without interference or obstruction and to receive it in the required format. 
- **More examples**:
	- Distributed Denial of services (DDoS).
		- in a DDoS attack, thousands of computers send a lot of traffic to the victim's ICT systems to overload the service.
		DDOS is something criminals sell on the internet as a service, and for a few hundred dollars anyone can hit a selected victim.

## Cybersecurity Cube
- Cybersecurity cube dimensions:
	- The CIA Triad
	- The states of information or data.
	- Cybersecurity safeguards or countermeasures
- All 27 areas must be properly addressed to ensure comprehensive system security.
	- **Example**:
		- Problem: A set of controls or safeguards()


## Cryptography
- The science around techniques used for protecting information from disclosure or dissemination.
![[Pasted image 20230925092950.png]]
- **Examples**
	- CÃ¦sar technique.
	- Enigma.

## Encryption keys
- Enigma - 158 162 555 217 826 360 000
- AES 128 - 2^128
- Symmetrical vs Asymmetrical. 

### symmetrical encryption 
- Sender & receiver use the same key.
- Enigma, DES, AES.
- Too difficult to keep the key safe.

### Asymmetrical  encryption
![[Pasted image 20230925093621.png]]
- Public key encryption (public-private match).
- RSA, DH, ECC.
- Private key should be kept safe.

### Other techniques
- Hash-function -> Hash files (lab)
- MAC function
- More info to come (Chapter 4)

## Security Culture
- Culture - one of the most dominant factors that differentiate nations.
	- All nations have cultures.
- National cultures shape us, as a group and individually.
	- Closely linked to out underling values.
		- Normal vs abnormal, safe vs unsafe, rational vs irrational, etc. 
- Different cultures bring different approaches to daily tasks and long-term activities.  

## Culture
- The set ideas, values and norms that a group of people share, and which they try to pass on to the next generation.
- it is also common.

## security culture Definitions
![[Pasted image 20230925094839.png]]
- it's about protecting digital assets from various forms of threats that target built-in vulnerabilities.
- (Digital) security culture can therefore be understood.

### Factors 
1. Set/Community
2. Management and control
3. Trust
4. Risk perception
5. Optimism for technology and digitalization
6. Competence
7. Interests in technology and IT
8. Behavior patterns.

#### Set/Community
- Cultures are developed by individuals, and at the same time cultures help shape individuals.
	- A long lasting culture requires loyalty and solidarity.

#### Management and control
- How should the community be regulated

#### Trust
- trust is a cornerstone of any functioning democracy

#### Risk perception
- Competence, learning and risk perception are closely related
- Risk behavior is linked to level of competence, perceived level of skill and experiences.  

#### Competence
- Everyone must have knowledge of and skills in digital security to be part of a modern society 
- Many businesses provide security training 

#### Behavior patterns
- Attitudes aren't really that interesting if they don't lead to action 
- Behavioral patterns can be observed over time. Are the norms for "secure behavior" followed?
- Norm

#### security culture
- Most studies focus on the behavioral dimension
	- Whether people want to click on a phishing link.
	- Whether they share their password with strangers.
	- Values and attitudes 

## Summary
- Cybersecurity is a team sport
	- You, your team and your organization vs the unknown
	-
