### Lab exercise

**Goals:**
1. Get familiar with commands “chmod”, “id”, “chown”, “useradd”, “usermod”, and “userdel”, and “passwd”.
#### **Task 1**(chmod)
As you can see from the picture below, everyone in group “kelly” is unable to modify file “animals”, how can you enable the write permission for the group based on Symbolic Representation?
![[Pasted image 20230922103525.png]]

After that, suppose you don’t want anyone to see the contents of file “animals” except the file owner and group owners, what command should you enter?
- `chmod 640 animals
- `chmod a-x,g-w,o-w animals`
- **a-x** removes executable from all groups 
- **g-w** removes write permission to group owner
- **o-w** removes write permission to users in the system(everyone else).
- "6" corresponds to read and write permissions for the file owner.
- "4" corresponds to read-only permission for the group owner.
- "0" corresponds to no permission for others (everyone else).

#### **Task 2**(chmod)
Does each of the following commands work? Why or why not?
![[Pasted image 20230922103833.png]]
- chmod o+r, o+2 animals
	- chmod: invalid mode: ‘o+r,’
![[Pasted image 20230922103839.png]]
- chmod o+r,o+w animals
	- Work, gives r and w to the user.
![[Pasted image 20230922103842.png]]
- chmod o= animals
	- Works removes the read possibility on the usergroup file
![[Pasted image 20230922103845.png]]
- chmod a=xrw animals
	- Gives full permissions 

#### **Task 3**(chmod)
Can you set permission “rwxrw----” to file “animals” based on Octal Number Representation?
- `chmod 770 test1
	- **7** corresponds to read, write, and execute permissions for the file owner.
	- **7** corresponds to read, write, and execute permissions for the group owner.
	- **0** corresponds to no permission for others (everyone else).


#### **Task 4**(chmod)
What will the file mode of file “animals” become after command “chmod 537 animals” is executed? What does the new file mode mean?
- it becomes -r-x-wxrwx 
	1. `-r-x-`: This part represents the permissions for the file owner    
	    - `-r-`: The file owner has read (r) permission.
	    - `-x-`: The file owner has execute (x) permission.
	    - `-w-`: The file owner does not have write permission.
	2. `wxr`: This part represents the permissions for the group owner.
	    - `w`: The group owner has write (w) permission.
	    - `x`: The group owner has execute (x) permission.
	    - `r`: The group owner has read (r) permission.
	3. `wxrwx`: This part represents the permissions for others (everyone else).
	    - `w`: Others have write (w) permission.
	    - `x`: Others have execute (x) permission.
	    - `r`: Others have read (r) permission

#### **Task 5**(chmod)
Suppose that “animals” is a file in your current working directory.
Is command “chmod 708 animals” valid? Why?
- **chmod: invalid mode: ‘708’** so it is not valid. 

Is command “chmod 000 animals” valid? Why? What does it mean?
- "----------" indicates that the file or directory has no permission for anyone, which effectively means it cannot be read from, written to, or executed by anyone, including the owner. This is the most restrictive permission setting possible.

#### **Task 6**(chown)
“chown” is a useful command to change file ownership. We use it to change the owner and group owner of a file/directory.

1. Can a regular user change the ownership of his/her file using command “chown”?
   - In general, regular users cannot change the ownership of their files using the `chown` command unless they have been granted specific privileges or permissions to do so. Changing ownership of a file typically requires superuser (root) privileges.
     
2. Does command “chown” allow us to specify the name of a target file/directory before specifying the target username? For example, does command “sudo chown f1.txt bob” work?
   - No, the `chown` command does not allow you to specify the name of the target file or directory before specifying the target username. In the `chown` command.
    
3. How do you change the owner of your file to the root user? What is the command for it?
   - ```shell
	sudo chown root yourfile
	
4. How do you change the owner of your file back to you, and change the group owner of the file to group “root”? What is the command for it?
   - `sudo chown yourusername:root yourfile
	- `yourusername` should be replaced with your actual username.
	- `root` specifies the new group owner.
	- `yourfile` should be replaced with the name of the file you want to change.

#### **Task 7**(id)
What command can we use to show our username and uid?
- you simply use the command `id`.
  
#### **Task 8**(useradd)
Suppose you have superuser privileges and you want to create a new user account called “jack” and assign a default home directory to it. What command should you type?
- `sudo useradd -m jack`
	- `sudo` is used to run the command with superuser privileges.
	- `useradd` is the command to add a new user.
	- `-m` is used to create the user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.

#### **Task 9**(useradd)
Suppose now you want to create another user called “amy” and create a specific home directory for her. Let’s say the directory should be called “amy” under the root directory (i.e., “/amy”). What command should you type?
- `sudo useradd -m -d /amy amy`
	- `sudo` is used to run the command with superuser privileges.
	- `useradd` is the command to add a new user.
	- `-m` is used to create the user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.
	- `-d /amy` specifies the custom home directory path as "/amy."
	- `amy` is the username you want to create.

#### **Task 10**(useradd)
Suppose that you have all superuser privileges in a Linux system. How can you create an account for your friend “Frank” such that the following requirements are all met?
1. Frank wants to have a special home directory called “pro” inside the root directory.
   - `sudo useradd -m -d /pro Frank`
	- `sudo` is used to run the command with superuser privileges.
	- `useradd` is the command to add a new user.
	- `-m` is used to create the user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.
	- `-d /pro` specifies the custom home directory path as "/pro."
	- `frank` is the username you want to create.
     
2. Frank should join both his primary group and another group called “amy”.
   - `sudo useradd -m -d /pro -G frank,amy frank`
	- `sudo` is used to run the command with superuser privileges.
	- `useradd` is the command to add a new user.
	- `-m` is used to create the user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.
	- `-d /pro` specifies the custom home directory path as "/pro."
	- `-G frank,amy` adds the user "frank" to both the "frank" group (primary group) and the "amy" group.
	- `frank` is the username you want to create.
     
3. Frank's full name “Frank Davies” should be recorded on the /etc/passwd file.
   - `sidp useradd -m -d/pro -G frank,amy -c "Frank Davies" frank`
	- `sudo` is used to run the command with superuser privileges.
	- `useradd` is the command to add a new user.
	- `-m` is used to create the user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.
	- `-d /pro` specifies the custom home directory path as "/pro."
	- `-G frank,amy` adds the user "frank" to both the "frank" group (primary group) and the "amy" group.
	- `-c "Frank Davies"` sets the user's comment to "Frank Davies," which typically includes the full name.
	- `frank` is the username you want to create.

#### **Task 11**(useradd)
Can you create another account called “Thomas” such that the following requirements are all met?
1. Thomas requests to have a specific uid, says “2000”. Note that 2000 is not occupied yet.
2. Thomas prefers to use “bash” as his login shell.
3. This account should expire on Dec. 31th, 2022.
4. This account should be disabled when Thomas’s password has expired for one week.
*  `sudo useradd -m -u 2000 -s /bin/bash -e 2022-12-31 -f 7 -c "Thomas" thomas
	*  `sudo` is used to run the command with superuser privileges.
	- `useradd` is the command to add a new user.
	- `-m` is used to create the user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.
	- `-u 2000` specifies the user ID (UID) as 2000.
	- `-s /bin/bash` sets the login shell to "bash."
	- `-e 2022-12-31` specifies the account expiration date as December 31, 2022.
	- `-f 7` sets the number of days after the password expires before the account is disabled to one week (7 days).
	- `-c "Thomas"` sets the user's comment (full name) to "Thomas."
	- `thomas` is the username you want to create.
`

#### **Task 12**(useradd)
Suppose you have done the previous task. Now you want to change the name of the account from “Thomas” to “Thomas001”, add this account to groups “amy” and “Frank”, change the account expiration date to Dec. 31th, 2021, and reset the inactivity period to the default value (-1). What command should you type?
- You cannot directly rename a user account. Instead, you can create a new user with the desired username, copy the data from the old user to the new one, and then delete the old user. Here's a summary of the steps:
  **Create a new user "Thomas001" with the same settings**
`sudo useradd -m -u 2000 -s /bin/bash -e 2021-12-31 -f -1 -c "Thomas001" thomas001

**Copy data from the old user's home directory to the new one**
`sudo rsync -a /home/Thomas/ /home/Thomas001/

**Set the password for the new user (replace 'yourpassword' with the desired password)**
`sudo passwd Thomas001

**Add the new user to groups "amy" and "Frank"**
`sudo usermod -a -G amy,Frank Thomas001

**Delete the old user "Thomas" (optional)**
`sudo userdel -r Thomas

#### **Task 13**(userdel)
How do you delete an account without deleting that account’s home directory?
- `sudo userdel username`

#### **Task 14**(userdel)
What command can we use to delete an account and the associated home directory?
- `sudo userdel -r username

#### **Task 15**(passwd)
How do you change your own password using the passwd command?
Note: You might not be able to test it on your SkyHiGh Ubuntu VM because the ubuntu account is password-free.
- `passwd`
	- you need to know your own password.

#### **Task 16**(passwd)
How do you change another account’s password using the passwd command?
- `sudo passwd username
	- replace username with the user you want to change the username for.
