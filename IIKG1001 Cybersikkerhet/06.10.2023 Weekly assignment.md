**Task 1**
Answer each of the following questions:
1. What is NOT a solution to address the issues of limited IPv4 addresses?
   a. Supernetting
   b. Subnetting
   c. CIDR
   d. NAT
   
*Answer:. D* (**NAT: Network Address Translation**)
NAT is not a solution to address the issues of limited IPv4 addresses. Instead, NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IPv4 address for accessing resources on the internet. It does not create more IPv4 addresses but rather conserves them by allowing multiple devices to use the same public address. Supernetting, subnetting, and CIDR are techniques that help manage and allocate existing IPv4 addresses more efficiently, but they don't create new addresses.

2. What is the problem with Classful Addressing?
   a. Address allocation is unreliable
   b. Address allocation is inefficient
   c. Address allocation is unsafe
   d. Address allocation is inflexible
   
   *Answer:. B*
   The problem with Classful Addressing is that it is inefficient in terms of address allocation. Classful addressing divides the available IPv4 address space into fixed classes (Class A, Class B, and Class C), each with a predetermined number of network and host bits. This rigid allocation scheme often leads to inefficient use of IP addresses because organizations may be allocated more addresses than they actually need (wasting addresses) or not enough addresses (resulting in address shortages).

3. ______ is to break an IP address space into several smaller spaces.
   a. Supernetting
   b. DHCP
   c. Subnetting
   d. IP
   
   *Answer:. C*
   Subnetting is the process of breaking an IP address space into several smaller subnetworks (subnets) to create a more efficient and organized network infrastructure. It allows an organization to allocate IP addresses based on its specific needs and helps with network management and routing efficiency.

4. is used to automatically assign an IP address to a computer when it connects to a network.
   a. IP
   b. DHCP
   c. Switch
   d. Router
   
   *Answer:. B (Dynamic Host Configuration protocol)*
   DHCP is used to automatically assign an IP address to a computer when it connects to a network. It simplifies network administration by dynamically managing the allocation of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network, eliminating the need for manual IP address assignments.

5.  is responsible for mapping private IP addresses to one public IP address.
   a. NAT
   b. IP
   c. ARP
   d. DHCP
   
   *Answer:. A*
   NAT (Network Address Translation) is responsible for mapping private IP addresses to one public IP address. It allows multiple devices on a local network with private IP addresses to share a single public IP address when accessing resources on the internet. NAT is commonly used to conserve public IPv4 addresses and improve network security by hiding internal network structures from external entities.

6. depends on port numbers to build one-to-one mapping between private IP addresses and public IP addresses.
   a. Transport layer of the TCP/IP model
   b. Port Address Translation (PAT)
   c. ARP
   d. DHCP
   
   *Answer:. B (Port Address Translation)*
   Port Address Translation (PAT) depends on port numbers to build a one-to-one mapping between private IP addresses and a single public IP address. It's a specific form of Network Address Translation (NAT) that uses port numbers to differentiate between multiple internal devices sharing the same public IP address. PAT allows multiple devices on a private network to communicate with the internet using the same public IP address by mapping their private IP addresses to unique port numbers.

**Task 2**
Answer each of the following questions:
1. Which of the following IP address is a valid CIDR notation?
   a. 128.123.22.2\1
   b. 128.123.22.2-16
   c. 128.123.22.2/24
   d. 128.123.22.2(29)
   
   *Answer:. C*
	The / says it is a CIDR format

2. What does "/24" mean in "192.168.110.13/24"?
   a. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.255
   b. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
   c. A subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
   d. A subnet mask of 192.168.110.0
   
   *Answer:. B.*
   In the notation "192.168.110.13/24," the "/24" indicates the subnet mask. Specifically, it represents a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used for host addresses within that subnet.

3. What does "/8" mean in "50.168.110.13/8"?
   a. A subnet mask of 255.0.0.0
   b. A subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
   c. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
   d. A subnet mask of 50.0.0.0
   
   *Answer:. A*
   In the notation "50.168.110.13/8," the "/8" indicates the subnet mask. Specifically, it represents a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0. This means that the first 8 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, and the remaining 24 bits are used for host addresses within that subnet. This is often referred to as a Class A network, where the first octet (8 bits) defines the network and the remaining three octets (24 bits) are available for hosts.

4. What is the net ID of "200.122.110.13/24"?
   a. 200.122.110.10
   b. 200.122.0.0
   c. 200.122.110.0
   d. 200.0.0.0
   
   *Answer:. C*
   In the IP address "200.122.110.13/24," the "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion. So, the network ID is "200.122.110.0," and the host portion can vary within that network.

5. What is the net ID of "40.122.110.13/8"?
   a. 40.0.0.0
   b. 40.122.0.0
   c. 40.122.110.0
   d. 40.122.110.13
   
   *Answer:. A*
   In the IP address "40.122.110.13/8," the "/8" indicates that the first 8 bits are used for the network portion. So, the network ID is "40.0.0.0," and the remaining 24 bits are available for host addresses within that network.

6. What is the host ID of "200.150.110.13/24"?
   a. .110.13
   b. .150.110.13
   c. .13
   d. .24
   
   *Answer:. C*
   In the IP address "200.150.110.13/24," the "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host portion. Therefore, the host ID is ".13."

7. What is the host ID of "100.150.100.134/8"?
   a. .100.134
   b. .150.100.134
   c. .134
   d. .8
   
   *Answer:. B*
  I apologize for any confusion. In the IP address "100.150.100.134/8," the "/8" indicates that the first 8 bits are used for the network portion. Therefore, the host ID is ".150.100.134."

8. What is the subnet mask of a /28 network?
   a. 255.255.255.240
   b. 255.255.254.0
   c. 255.255.255.254
   d. 255.255.255.224

*Answer:. A*
When working with CIDR notation, the number following the slash (/) indicates how many bits are used for the network portion of the subnet mask. In this case, a /28 network uses the first 28 bits for the network portion, leaving 4 bits for the host portion.

**Task 3**
Answer each of the following questions:
1. How many subnets will be generated by extending a net ID from 8 bits to 11 bits?
	When you extend the network ID portion from 8 bits to 11 bits, you are borrowing 3 additional bits for subnetting. Each additional bit can double the number of subnets.

	With 8 bits, you have 2^8 = 256 possible combinations (from 0 to 255) for the network ID. When you extend it to 11 bits, you have 2^11 = 2048 possible combinations for the network ID.

	To calculate how many subnets are generated, subtract the original number of subnets (256) from the new number of subnets (2048):

	**2048 - 256 = 1792**


2. How many subnets will be generated by extending a net ID from 24 bits to 29 bits?
	A net id from 24 is 1 as this is a single subnet so it will be 2^29-1
	so it will be **2^29-1=536870911*

3. By taking 4 bits from the original host ID part, ___ subnetworks can be created.
	**i would be able to create 16 subnetworks. 

4. By taking 6 bits from the original host ID part, ___ subnetworks can be created.
	**i would be able to create 64 subnets**

5. How many subnets does a network of "50.250.180.0/13" provide?
   to calculate this we can take a full subnet that is 2^32 and minus it on the size we provide, so it would be **2^(32-13) = 524288**

6. How many subnets does a network of 190.250.180.0 with a subnet mask of "/19" provide?
	we do the same as in 5 **2^(32-19) = 8192**

7. A /27 CIDR block provides  assignable IP addresses.
	*192.168.1.223/27 gives 32 Ip addresses to be assigned* 

8. A /9 CIDR block provides ______ assignable IP addresses.
   *with CIDR /9 gives us 8388608 IP addresses to be assigned*

**Task 4**
Answer the following questions:
1. What is the CIDR notation of subnet mask 255.224.0.0?
   **that gives a CIDR /11** because the first 8 bits is set to 1 and the next part is set to 11100000 so 
   8+3 = 11

2. What is the decimal form and CIDR notation of subnet mask 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000?
   **255.255.240.0**
   **255.255.240.0/20**

**Task 5**
Answer the following questions:
1. Are the following two IP addresses in the same network?
   - 128.143.137.32/26
     10000000.10001111.10001000.00*010000*
     11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
   - 128.143.137.144/26
     10000000.10001111.10001000.10*010000*
     11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
     Yes they are on the same network 

2. Are the following two IP addresses in the same network?
   - 128.143.137.32/23
     
   - 128.143.137.144/23
