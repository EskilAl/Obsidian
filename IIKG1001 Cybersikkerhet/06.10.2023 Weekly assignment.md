**Task 6**
Do you know how to find your public IP addresses on your laptop, smartphone, and tablet?
Do you know how to find your private IP addresses on your different devices?
Read here and practice.
Note:
- On Windows, you may also use the command “ipconfig” to find out your address info.
- On Mac OS or Linux distributions, you can use commands “ip” or “ifconfig”.
- Here you can see the differences between “ipconfig” and “ifconfig”.

**Task 7**
In what scenario do your devices share the same public IP address while having different private IP addresses? Can you explain?

**Task 8**
1. What is the difference between the execution result of the command “ip a” and command “ip link”?

2. What does “lo” mean? What is the function of IP address “127.0.0.1”? Google the answer if you are unsure.

3. How can you see the IP address associated with each of your network interfaces?

4. How can you know the MAC address associated with your network interfaces?

5. How can you know if your network interfaces are up and running?

6. How do you know the IPv6 address of your network interfaces?

**Task 9**
Now try to use the command “ip” to view all the routes on that virtual machine. Can you explain all the routes?

**Task 11**
In this task, we are going to be using the dig and nslookup commands to gather information about the domain ntnu.no.
Use nslookup or dig to answer the following questions:
1. What is the A record of “ntnu.no”? Note that the “A” stands for Address.

2. What is the MX of “ntnu.no”?

3. What is the function of the NS record (or nameserver record)?

4. What is the difference between a pointer (PTR) record and an A record?

5. Use reverse DNS lookup on 129.241.78.12. What is the domain name of this IP address?
