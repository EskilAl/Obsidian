	- Capital & labor as production factors
	- Transformed into products/services
	- Consumed by environments in return for supply inputs
- Behavioral definition 
	- · A collection of rights, privileges, obligations, and responsibilities balanced over a period of time through conflict and conflict resolution.
- **Differences between the views

		- Implementing a new system
	- Technical and behavioral views are not contradictory.
