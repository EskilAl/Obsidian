**IIKG1001 Week 36 Lab Exercise**

**Goals:**
1. Get familiar with the command line interface.
2. Get familiar with Linux file navigation, permissions, and manipulation.
3. Get familiar with `su` and `sudo`.
4. Have fun! 😊

**Task 1**

**What information can you see from your shell prompt?**
- You can see the user that is logged on and where you are. If you see `~$`, it is the home directory.
- If you see `/$`, then you are in the top-level directory, also known as the root.

**Task 2**

**Now try to type any random string or characters on the terminal. How does the shell reply to you?**
- If you type something random, it may ask if you want to install a command.
- If you type something that doesn't correspond to a known command, it will respond with "command not found."

**Task 3**

**Now open your CLI on Ubuntu. Try to type `pwd`.**
1. What do you see?
   - I see the path to my home directory.
2. Is the result shown as an absolute pathname or a relative pathname?
   - It's a relative pathname as it only shows `home/ubuntu`.
3. Why does the result start with a forward slash '/'? What does this symbol mean?
   - It means it's a directory, and you are either in more directories inside your directory if it is followed by another `/`.

**Task 4**

**Type `cd /` on your CLI and then type `pwd`.**
1. What do you see?
   - There is no such file in my directory.
2. Which directory are you in now?
   - I'm still in my Ubuntu directory.
3. What command can you type to get the high-level content of this directory?
   - `ls -l`
4. Now try to type `cd ..`. What directory are you in now? Do you know why the command "cd .." does not change your current working directory?
   - I am moved one directory up, and I'm now in my home directory.
5. How do you go back to your home directory? What command should you type? Write down all possible commands.
   - Type `ls` to see what is in the directory, only `ubuntu`. Type `cd` and then tap to auto-fill to `ubuntu`. Then press enter, and you are back in your home directory.

**Task 5**

**How do you see detailed contents in a directory? What option should you specify to the "ls" command? Please try the root directory since your home directory is empty by default.**
- To see detailed contents, you can type `ls -l`. If you only want a small overview, you can type `ls -h`.

**Task 6**

**Suppose there are many files and directories under a directory.**
1. What command enables us to see all of them in detail from the newest modification time to the oldest modification time?
   - To see this, you can use `ls -lt`.
2. What command enables us to see all of them in detail from the oldest modification time to the newest modification time?
   - To see this, you can use `ls -ltr`.

**Task 7** Try to type `ls -trl /`. Do you think the execution result of this command is the same as that of `ls -ltr /`? Can you explain why?
* i think it's the same, i can't see any difference to the output in the terminal. 

**Task 8** What is the difference between commands `ls -d` and `ls -dl`? Type both commands and write down your answer.
* The 'dl -d' gives worse information than 'ls -dl' as with the latter i get more information.  aka */ 

**Task 9** How do you use the `ls` command to see the details of a particular directory, e.g., "Documents"?
* This command will list the contents of the "Documents" directory in long format, showing details like permissions, owner, group, file size, modification date, and file/directory names.


**Task 10**
1. What is the function of command `less`?
- It opens a reader for my Selected text. aka 'less plain.txt'
3. How do you use `less` to see the content of a big file, e.g., "/etc/passwd"? Write down the complete command.
- example you just write `less  /etc/passwd`
5. How do you scroll up or down the file content?
- you press the arrow up and down to scroll in the document.
7. How do you search a keyword, e.g., "login"?
- just press the '/' key
9. How do you exit the `less` command?
- to exit you press q

**Task 11**
1. Now I believe you have typed a lot of commands on your CLI, how can you clear your screen? What command should you type?
- type `clear`
3. Try to scroll up the screen after you type that command. Can you still see what you typed earlier?
- no i can't

**Task 12** 
Take a look at the picture below. Which user owns all these files and directories? Which group owns all these files and directories?
![[Pasted image 20230908110237.png]]

Kelly owns the Directory she has rw -r -r

**Task 13**
1. According to the picture shown in the previous task, which of them are directories?
- We can see a directory as the color blue or, by the text drwxr -xr -x
3. Who is able to write/modify file "animals"?
   - the owner is able to write/modify the file 'animals' also kelly can do this.
4. Who can see the content of directory 'command'?
- The owner of the directory can see the content, create files, delete files, and execute files within the directory.
- Members of the group that this directory belongs to can see the content and execute files within the directory but cannot create or delete files unless they have additional permissions on the parent directory.
- Any other user (outside the owner and group) can also see the content and execute files within the directory but cannot create or delete files unless they have additional permissions on the parent directory.
5. Who can delete and rename a file from directory 'command'?
   - only the owner can delete or rename the directory 

**Task 14** Go to your home directory by typing "cd" or "cd ~". By default setting, this directory is empty. Now try to create three new files, named "file1", "report2", "test3", with the command below:

bash

`touch file1 report2 test3`

Or you can separately create these files with the following three commands:

- `touch file1`
- `touch report2`
- `touch test3`

Now try to use command `ls -l` to see if you have successfully created these three files. What is the size of each file? The `cat` command is another command to quickly create a short text file. Please try to create a short text file using `cat` and then use the same command to display the content of the file.

you can make a new file with `cat > filename` then write what you want inside the text file and press `Ctrl + D` to save it. 
to see the size you can type `ls -lt` this shows that the file i make is 8 bytes.

**Task 15** How do you make a copy for "file1" and name it as "file1_copy"? Write down the command.
* command to copy a file is `cp` so to copy a file you do `cp file1 file1_copy` 

**Task 16** Can you make two copies of a file using the `cp` command? For example, does command `cp file1 f1_cp1 f1_cp2` work?
- no you can not, it said target  'test_copy2' is not a directory.

**Task 17** Is it possible to use the `cp` command to copy a file to a non-existing directory? Please try it.
- you can not copy to a non-existing directory

**Task 18** Try to create three subdirectories, named "computer", "command", and "network", under your home directory using command `mkdir`. Can you use one single command to create the three subdirectories at the same time? Please try it yourself and then write down that command.
- `mkdir computer command network` is the command to make more directories. 

**Task 19** Is it possible to use the `cp` command to copy an existing directory to a non-existing directory? Please try it.
- no you cannot copy a existing directory to a non existing directory. 


**Task 20** Please be familiar with the following table for command `cp item1 item2`.

|The Type of item1|The Type of item2|The result of the command|
|---|---|---|
|A file|An existing file|item2 will be overwritten by the content of item1.|
|A file|A non-existing file|item2 will be created as a file and has the same content as item1.|
|A file|An existing directory|item1 will be copied and stored in directory item2.|
|A file|A non-existing directory|A file called item2 will be created, and it will have the same content as item1. In other words, item2 will not be created as a directory.|
|A directory|An existing directory|Directory item1 will be copied and become a subdirectory of directory item2.|
|A directory|A non-existing directory|A directory called item2 will be created, and it will have the same content as item1.|

**Task 21** What is the command to rename file "homework.txt" to "homework2.txt"?
- the command to rename a file is `mv homework.txt homework2.txt` if you just mv the file to the same directory you will rename it.

**Task 22** Read the description below to learn how to quickly delete all files and subdirectories from a directory without deleting the directory itself. Attention: Don’t try it under any of your important directories!!! Try to create a directory and do the experiment there.

You can delete all files and directories under your current directory by simply typing command `rm -r *`. Here the `*` wildcard is used since it can be expanded to any characters. In other words, `*` will be expanded into any filenames and directory names that are under your current directory. These names will become the real arguments to the `rm` command and then be deleted.

As you can see from the picture below, all files and directories are deleted since nothing is shown by the `ls` command.

![[Pasted image 20230908113618.png]]

You can see that using wildcard `*` together with the `rm` command is dangerous since they might delete something you don’t expect to delete. Once you have deleted a file/directory, there is no way to restore the action on Linux. Hence, you must be very careful when you use them.

It would be safer to additionally specify option `i` to the `rm` command since we will be prompted for confirmation to each deletion action. As the following picture shows, I answered 'y' to remove file1 but 'n' to the rest two files. Therefore, only file1 was deleted.

**Task 23**

1. What will happen if you enter command `cat /etc/shadow`?
   - Permission denied. 
2. What should you do to see the content of file `/etc/shadow`? Note: `/etc/shadow` is a text file that contains the password information of all user accounts.
   - `sudo cat etc/shadow` give me permissions to read the file 

**Task 24** Try to type `sudo su`. Do you see?
- i see the superuser, to exit you just type exit.

This is the end of this lab document. Hope you have enjoyed it and learned a lot. 
