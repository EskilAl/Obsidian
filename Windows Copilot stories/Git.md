Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps to install Git, create an SSH key, and push to your first repository on GitHub.

## install git 
1. [To install Git on Windows, you can download the latest installer from the Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)[1](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instructions. [Alternatively, you can use a package manager like Chocolatey](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)[2](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) [or Homebrew](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001927.htm)[3](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001927.htm) to install Git from the command line.

## SSH KEY
2. To create an SSH key on Windows, you can use the built-in OpenSSH client that comes with Windows 10 and 11. Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator and type `ssh-keygen -t rsa` "Same on mac" followed by a passphrase. This will generate a pair of SSH keys and save them in the `C:\Users\[YourUserName]\.ssh` folder by default. [You can also specify a different algorithm, name, or location for your keys if you want](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)[4](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-git-bash-on-windows/).

	`ssh-keygen -f C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MySSHKey`

3. To push to your first repository on GitHub, you need to add your public key to your GitHub account. [You can do this by copying the content of your `id_rsa.pub` file (or whatever name you gave to your public key file) and pasting it in the SSH keys section of your account settings](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows)[5](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows). [Then you need to create a new repository on GitHub and copy its SSH URL](https://www.howtogeek.com/762863/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-in-windows-10-and-windows-11/)[6](https://www.howtogeek.com/762863/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-in-windows-10-and-windows-11/). Next, you need to add the remote URL to your local repository using the command `git remote add origin [SSH-URL]`. [Finally, you can push your local changes to the remote repository using the command `git push origin main` (or whatever branch name you want)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement)[7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement).`)
