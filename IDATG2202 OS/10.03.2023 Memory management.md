Memory management is the process of managing the use of memory in a computer system. Memory management involves allocating and deallocating memory to programs and data, as well as ensuring that the memory is used efficiently and securely.

Memory management is essential for the performance and functionality of a computer system. Without memory management, programs would not be able to run, data would be lost or corrupted, and the system would be vulnerable to attacks.

[There are different levels of memory management in a computer system, such as hardware memory management, operating system memory management, and application memory management](https://www.memorymanagement.org/mmref/index.html)[1](https://www.memorymanagement.org/mmref/index.html).

Hardware memory management is the lowest level of memory management, which deals with the physical memory of the computer. Hardware memory management involves mapping logical addresses generated by the CPU to physical addresses in the main memory. [Hardware memory management also supports features such as virtual memory, cache memory, and memory protection](https://www.memorymanagement.org/mmref/index.html)[1](https://www.memorymanagement.org/mmref/index.html).

Operating system memory management is the intermediate level of memory management, which deals with the allocation and deallocation of memory to processes and files. [Operating system memory management involves techniques such as swapping, contiguous memory allocation, paging, and segmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/). [Operating system memory management also handles issues such as fragmentation, compaction, and relocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/).

Application memory management is the highest level of memory management, which deals with the allocation and deallocation of memory to objects and variables within a program. [Application memory management involves techniques such as static and dynamic loading, static and dynamic linking, manual and automatic memory management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/). [Application memory management also handles issues such as memory leaks, dangling pointers, and garbage collection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/).

Memory management is a complex and challenging task that requires careful design and implementation. Memory management can affect the speed, reliability, security, and portability of a computer system. Therefore, it is important to understand the principles and techniques of memory management in order to develop efficient and robust programs.
