# Week 1
1. What is a "Directive" in assembly code?
   - it's an instruction but in assembly. 

2. Briefly explain the concepts *super scalar and pipeline*. 
   - in order for the CPU to work as efficiently as possible we get take the instruction an make it like a assembly line, this we call a pipeline, and a scalar is a unit that executes the instructions in the pipeline, if we have a super scalar it means that we have more than one scalar, and it can execute more instructions simultaneous.    

3. What does a C-compiler like gcc do? What is the difference between C-code, assembly code and machine code?
   - it takes the code and compiles so i can run on the selected operating system 

4. (KEY PROBLEM) Based on the examples of C-code and assembly code we have covered in this chapter, explain what each line in the following assembly code does:
