### 1. 100% CPU-intensive process (does computations continously) uses five minutes to complete on a dual-core CPU with hyperthreading. If we start four such processes on the same system, how much time would pass before they all complete?

### 2. How does a modern operating system make it possible to run multiple processes "simultaneously" (at the same time) on a CPU?
### 3. How long does a clock cycle (clock period) last on a 3 GHz CPU?

### 4. If ~/bin is in the environment variable PATH, it means that:
### 5. The assembly code (AT&T/GNU syntax)  mov -4(%rbp), %eax  does the following:
### 6. The relationship between commands, system calls and instructions is: 
### 7. What is it called when a write operation is not completed until data has been written to both cache and internal memory?
### 8.  What will be printed on the screen (in the terminal window) by the following program (given that it does not fail in any way)?
```
main ()  {  
   int p;  
   p = fork();  
   if(p==0) {  
       printf("Child!");  
       exec("/usr/bin/gedit")  
   }  
   printf("Parent!");  
   return 0;  
}
```
### 9. Which instructions can be executed in user mode?
### 10.  Why can't the operating system (OS) execute a normal sequential process (e.g. a standard C program you have written without any use of fork) in parallel on a dualcore CPU?
